Quick fix: Please manually delete lines 541-542 from geminiService.ts:

Line 541:                         memorizationTip: ""
Line 542:                 });

These lines are causing a syntax error. After deleting them, the code will work correctly.

The VerseSurfer game will now have access to:
- words: Array of words from the verse
- distractors: Array of distractor words

This will fix the "Error" display issue in the game.
